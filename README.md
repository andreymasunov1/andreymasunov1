## About me

### Greetings! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Andrey Masunov, and I'm delighted to share a bit about some of my interests.

-------------------------------

### Audiobooks:
I have a profound love for audiobooks, immersing myself in worlds crafted by brilliant authors. If you're looking for recommendations, my top picks include timeless classics like:
1. [The Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings)
2. [The little Golden Calf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Golden_Calf)
3. [Adventures of Sherlock Holmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes)

### Traveling:
Traveling is not just a hobby for me; it's a way of life. Over the next few years, my sights are set on exploring following cities:
* London 
* Tokyo
* Beijing
* Singapore
* New York

---------------------------

### Cooking:
Cooking is my creative outlet, and I take pride in preparing delicious meals that satisfy both my taste buds and those of anyone fortunate enough to join me at the table.
My favorite cousine is the same which I ate at my homeland, but I like experiments and trying to eat something new from time to time.
